# URI Tides Widget

Add the `[uri-tides]` shortcode to a page and a tides widget appears.  Requires the [URI Tides Updater](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-tides-updater) plugin to be installed and activated on at least one site.

## Attributes

The tides widget is somewhat configurable by adding attributes to the shortcode:

**`height`** (num)(optional)  
Set a height in pixels for the tide chart (do not include units). The water temp will scale accordingly. (default: `30`)

**`darkmode`** (bool)(optional)  
Toggle a light display for placement on dark backgrounds (default: `false`)

**`class`** (string)(optional)  
Set custom CSS class(s) (default: none)
